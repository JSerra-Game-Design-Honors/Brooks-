      Text:
        m_Untranslated: 'Add another AI jet from Assets -> Add To Scene -> AiraftJetAI
          (Drag it to your scene).


          Rename that jet in the Hierarchy window
          so you will be able to tell them apart.


          While the new AI jet
          is selected, go to the Inspector window and look for the Aeroplane AI Control
          script.  Change the Target to your first AI jet.

          You can also
          disable the Waypoint Progress Tracker script (uncheck the box) to avoid
          getting errors.


          Use the Transform to move the jet farther behind
          the runway so that it will be behind the other jets and not start out colliding
          with them.


          Repeat this process to add another AI jet that will
          follow the player''s jet as well (AircraftJet).


          Play around
          and test using multiple jets different speeds, and adjustments to your
          course!


          When you are finished and have a project that contains
          a unique course, as well as AI jets that follow the player and the other
          AI jet, click "Next" below.'
